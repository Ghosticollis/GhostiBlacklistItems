# GhostiBlacklistItems
Unturned blacklist items spawn

this module will prevent blacklisted items from spawning in your server.
for example, you could prevent Stealy Wheely from spawning, prevent raid gear or prevent stuff like drugs, alcohol ... etc

please note:
this is a module, not a rocket mod plugin
it is the same idea, but this run on any server, even if it doesn't have rocket mod

how to setup:

compile the cs files as a .Net framework class library (more info you could search tutorials how to create Unturned Module)

after you compile the module you will get a file called GhostiBlacklistItems.dll

put the dll file inside the folder GhostiBlacklistItems

copy the folder GhostiBlacklistItems to your Unturned server folder and put it under the folder "Modules"

how to use:
add items id to the config file (/Module/GhostiBlacklistItems/config.txt)
and that's it
