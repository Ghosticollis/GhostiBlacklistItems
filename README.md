# GhostiBlacklistItems
Unturned blacklist items/vehicles spawn

this module will prevent blacklisted items/vehicles from spawning in your server.
for example, you could prevent Stealy Wheely from spawning, prevent raid gear or prevent stuff like drugs, alcohol ... etc
also you could use to prevent specific vehicles from spawning.


- please note:
this is a module, not a rocket mod plugin
it is the same idea, but this run on any server, even if it doesn't have rocket mod


- please note 2: 
it is very recomended to compile it by your own. to do that you need to compile the cs files as a .Net framework class library (more info you could search tutorials how to create Unturned Module)
in case you don't want to get your own build, I have supplied a compiled and ready to use build.


# how to setup:
copy the folder `GhostiBlacklistItems` to your Unturned server folder and put it under the folder `Modules`



# how to use:
add items id to the config file `/Module/GhostiBlacklistItems/config.txt`
and that's it
